# MATLAB-CFD-code-for-transient-1D-heat-conduction-using-explicit-scheme
This is a general MATLAB CFD code for transient 1D heat transfer of a symmetric block. This solves the equations using explicit scheme of transient finite volume method for time discretization. This code is written without the use of functions so that more emphasis is given to the procedural problem solving of a CFD program. This code is purely for educational purposes, not to accurate enough for actual problem solving. This code can be taken as a reference to the introduction to CFD course assignments.
